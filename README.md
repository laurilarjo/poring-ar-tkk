# PoringAR - Augmented Reality Mobile Game

Augmented reality game using Kharma-framework. Developed in 2010 on a university augmented reality course by Lauri & Joona.

*"Real world has invisible monsters lurking around us. They come alive when pointing them with the PoringAR app, and the fighting begins! Hunt Porings and collect Jellopies in true Ragnarok style in this Augmented Reality Mobile Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Game (ARMMMORPG!)"*

## Timeline context (written September 2018)

AR was a coming thing in the tech industry, and positioning virtual objects on a digital view was based on QR-tags. iPhone's browser was powerful, and Apple added the possibility for 3rd party apps to use the camera view in 2009, so it was possible to create a browser-based AR framework. This is what we used at the course, but instead of lame QR-based positioning, we used GPS coordinates for monsters, so user wouldn't need any extra material to play. The monster locations could be distributed from the backend server. Thinking about this now, we basically created a 1st version of Pokemon Go back in 2010! :D
